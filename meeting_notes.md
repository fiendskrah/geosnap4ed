spopt to be consumed by geosnap/gates project
    describing bug with spank
    - create issue to bring other eyes - possibly easy to resolve

make a note to formally document release note tooling 
    effort to resolve inconsistencies from 15 separate efforts in pysal package
    management

how to make the pipeline for both SEDA and Urban share the same DNA?
    will need to upload SEDA archive into our own bucket

Compare Tobler interpolations with Reardon's data manipulations
    view these manipulations as an optimization question?
    Or an areal overlay problem

kickoff meeting brainstorm
    get insights from end users and stakeholders
        what are their needs? incorporate into design
    
add bill and melinda gates logo to CGS website
    cutting edge spatial analysis to understand educational opportunity
    PR for the university (gates pays attention to UCR; they reached out to us first) 
    long term investments in labors of love pay off. (pysal/geosnap)

wiki pages on main github repo for meeting notes

dimension of accessibilty to public transit in education outcomes?
    school bus routes as defining districts

## gates
meeting with adam
 - gonna connect us to urban and stanford
 - as well as harvard + gates locally
 - int'l development program at gates - further work

use adam as a resource in interfacing with datasets
 - familiarity from prolonged use

plans:
 - exploratory notebooks for mashing datasets together
 - push early and often
 - don't worry about perfection in early stages

SPopt
 - moving code for maxP heuristic from spank into SPopt
 - spatial optimization aspect important for gates work

tobler sprint - bringing interpolation problems together from various pysal
threads.

this week: focus on NCES 
 - attendance zones
 - locales
 - school districts

relationship between school and neighborhood and vice versa
 - real segregation at school vs counterfactual segregation given context of
   neighborhood
   - student outcomes as a function of spatial context (2 schools with similar
     student body, but different purchasing power)
    
geographies
 - attendance zones
    differentiate between primary/secondary schools
 - school districts
 - locales

# 12/16

Eli update:
branding - cannot use logo without specific language
Adam hitting networks for end-users
    tuesday 5th (after 10am) or friday 8th (any time) for meeting
    TNTP the new teacher project 
performed some ESDA with education outcomes and unions with different
geographies
set up sprint time for next week
reach out to IECC/nonprofits with natural synergy with the project.
